# North Social

A decentralized, censorship-resistant social network protocol for Canada. Built on a peer-to-peer network of user-owned home servers, North Social prioritizes data sovereignty, high performance, and an open, federated ecosystem.

This project is licensed under the AGPLv3.

## The Problem

Contemporary social media platforms are centralized, single points of failure. They control user data, dictate content moderation policies, and are vulnerable to censorship, corporate influence, and government pressure. Users do not own their online identity or their data.

## The Solution

North Social is a protocol designed to create a social network that is resilient, open, and owned by its users. It achieves this by eliminating central servers and distributing all network functions across a fleet of low-cost, user-operated hardware nodes.

### Core Principles

*   **Data Sovereignty:** Users own their identity and data. All content is stored in a user-controlled, cryptographically-signed data repository.
*   **Decentralization:** The network runs on user-owned **Home Nodes** (e.g., single-board computers), eliminating reliance on corporate infrastructure.
*   **Censorship Resistance:** The distributed architecture and user-controlled moderation make it technically infeasible for any single entity to censor content or de-platform users network-wide.
*   **High Performance:** A proactive, caching-first design aims to provide a user experience that is competitive with modern, centralized platforms.
*   **Open Protocol:** North Social is a FOSS specification. Anyone can build a client or contribute to its development.

## Project Status

**Phase 0: Specification & Community Building**

The project is currently in the technical specification and planning phase. Code development has not yet commenced. We are actively seeking community feedback on the protocol design.
