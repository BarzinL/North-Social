# Contributing to North Social

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the North Social project. We welcome and appreciate all valuable contributions.

## Current Project Phase

The project is currently in the **Specification Phase**. At this stage, we are not yet accepting code contributions. Our primary focus is on refining the technical specification to ensure it is robust, secure, and viable before implementation begins.

## How to Contribute

The most valuable contribution at this time is providing feedback on the protocol design.

1.  **Read the Documentation:** Before contributing, please thoroughly review the **[Technical Specification](./SPECIFICATION.md)** and the **[Development Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md)**.
2.  **Open a GitHub Issue:** The best way to propose changes, ask questions, or raise concerns about the specification is by opening an issue in this repository.

### Issue Guidelines

Please use the following prefixes in your issue titles to help us categorize feedback:

*   **`[PROPOSAL]`:** For proposing a new feature or a change to an existing part of the specification.
    *   *Example: `[PROPOSAL] Use QUIC as the primary transport protocol`*
*   **`[QUESTION]`:** For asking for clarification about a part of the specification.
    *   *Example: `[QUESTION] How is Sybil resistance handled in the DHT?`*
*   **`[CONCERN]`:** For raising a potential problem, security vulnerability, or logical flaw.
    *   *Example: `[CONCERN] Sharding of private data may be vulnerable to traffic analysis`*

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to our **[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**. Please ensure you have read and understood it.

We look forward to building this project with the community.
